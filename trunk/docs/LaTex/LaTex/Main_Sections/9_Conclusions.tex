\section{Conclusions}
The goal of the teamâ€™s project was to create a software tool designed to assist the BBC's archiving process by automatically extracting and summarising 
audiovisual data for the purpose of assisting in archiving and supporting content reuse.

The team accomplished this by producing a multiplatform application which brings together various video and text analysis technologies in order to 
extract meaningful and reusable metadata. This has been achieved by implementing modules that perform: Natural Language Processing on Subtitles, key 
interest points identification in video and audio features. Followed by presenting this information to the user. The results are produced by discovering: 
Person and Location names mentioned in Subtitles, high volume audio sections and querying an external data source. The final product also includes some 
facial detection and analysis functionality, however this has not been fully incorporated into the final system.

The team has investigated a great number of areas and has produced a system that is likely to be used in future projects. Future work that could be 
completed as part of this project is detailed in the following section.
