\section*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank Paul Lewis and John Hare for their time, assistance and advice
throughout our project. Thanks must also be given to our client Matthew Addis who
has managed to meet us regularly and examine our work as we progressed, despite a busy
schedule. Finally we would like to thank the OpenIMAJ team who have provided advice and support in using the OpenIMAJ library and helping us to tackle the difficult problems of video and audio processing.
